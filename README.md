#  Spotify Clone (Partially Responsive)

This is a **Spotify Clone** built using **HTML and CSS**. It mimics the layout and styling of Spotify but is **not fully responsive**, meaning it may not work all the components.

##  Features
-  **Basic UI Design** – Includes a sidebar, playlists, and a music player.
-  **Partially Responsive** – Works fine on larger screens but may not be optimized for mobile.
-  **Static Music Player UI** – Styled playback controls without functionality.
-  **Playlist & Album Layouts** – Displays songs and albums in a Spotify-like format.
-  **Uses CSS Flexbox/Grid** for structuring the layout.
